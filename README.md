# Description
This is the content of mini project 2. The main task for this project is to get to class and on the way interact with some of the people at school. Within the school, there are teachers and students that you can interact with and greet. One student has different dialogue depending on if you have already talked to him. Within this project, certain people will also turn to face you while others will just project their thoughts out loud or just talk. To complete the task, the player will head to class, greet the teacher, and press the button behind the table. 

# Issues
One issue I had with this project was trying to make sure that the people within the school looked and acted realistically. Getting students to face you and talk to you realistically took a good bit of time for this project. Since the avatars look very detailed, making sure their animations and actions looked very accurate took a lot of tweaking and small changes.

# Video

Due to the size limitation in GitHub the video will be added to the eLC submission for assignment 2.
(As a workaround, placing the video within a zip folder seems to work)
