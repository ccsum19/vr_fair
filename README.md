# Description
This is the content of Group 2's final project. Our project is about a fair consisting of games and attractions similar to ones that you can find at carnivals, fairs, and amusement parks. The goal of this project is to fill up a box with randomly generated prizes. To get a prize dropped in the box, the player will need to get enough points through games. The main hub of our project is where people can socialize and interact with other players. Within the main hub, there are tents where you can interact with a button to be sent to games and attractions. Some of the attractions and games include basketball, maze, chance game, and the world's largest banana. 

# Issues
One issue that we faced while developing is how to provide a way for players to accumulate points. After a lot of research and testing, we ended up using a static variable to carry player points. A static variable allows scripts to all share one instance of a variable, allowing point accumulationg through multiple scripts to be done easily. Another issue we had was dealing with synchronization of objects within our project, but after a lot of trial and error we were able to understand how the network works and how to implement it.

# Video

Due to the size limitation in GitHub the video will be added to the eLC submission for final project.
